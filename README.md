### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1643514974/10003/catjam.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**Hrishikesh**](https://gojodennis.netlify.app/), An AI-focused frontend designer building automations with no-code tools, based in India..

I love building automation and find an efficient way (lazy way) to work 10x the norm.

Outside of code and Figma, you’ll find me reading brain rot self-improvement books, cleaning stuff, or drawing. I also enjoy writing [blog posts](https://gojodennis.hashnode.dev/) and sharing tech-related content on social media.

#### Fun Facts:

* I love doodling stuff.
* Jujutsu Kaisen is my favorite anime.
